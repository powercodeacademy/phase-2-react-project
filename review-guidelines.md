# Phase 2 Project Review Guidelines

## Project Requirements

Make sure your project meets all the project requirements. Here's a link to the
project guidelines:

- [Phase 2 Project Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-hooks-phase-2-project)

We also expect you to complete the following items prior to scheduling the
review:

- **[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A well-written informative README.md file**. This is
  the business card of your project and you really want it to look great! A
  template can be found here: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/).
  Some additional considerations:
  - If you used someone else's pictures or material please make sure you give
    them credit in your README.
  - If you think your blog post and/or video are really good and would add
    value, add them to your README.md.
  - If you want to go above and beyond, record a few seconds of yourself
    navigating the app and turn it into a gif. Then, add the gif in your
    README.md. That way anyone can get a sense of how your app works without
    leaving the README's page on GitHub!
- **[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A detailed commit history (30+ commits is your minimum
  goal)**. Committing frequently is a fundamental best practice that you want to
  acquire as soon as possible. One day you will be collaborating on projects and
  you'll notice the importance of committing even more. Commit messages should
  be in the present tense, 50 characters or less and they should describe the
  changes you are committing.

## What To Expect From the Project Review

Project reviews are focused on preparing you for [technical interviews][]. Treat
project reviews as if they were technical interviews, in both attitude and
technical presentation.

During your project review, be prepared to:

1. Walk through the app and showcase all the functionality you built. In this
   section, we want to make sure you satisfied all the requirements as well as
   best practices. (~10 minutes)
2. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. You will also be asked
   questions that test your knowledge of React fundamentals. Use the best technical
   vocabulary you can. We'll help you with the words you can't remember or those
   you find difficult to pronounce. (~15-20 minutes)
3. Refactor code and add new functionality. (~15-20 minutes)

If any requirements are missing or if significant gaps in understanding are
found, be prepared to do one or all of the following:

- Extend the application with a new feature, more data, a different domain etc.
- Submit an improved version
- Meet again for another Project Review

If the session reaches an hour in length, the assessment will end at that point.

What won't happen:

- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it
